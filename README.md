## Bluetooth Control Remote Car
This is an obstacle avoidance remote control bluetooth car which is controlled via mobile application. There is a sonar sensor in front of the car to detect forward obstacle/object and an IR sensor behind the car to detect the backward object/obstacle. Sonar and IR sensors detect the distance of any object and helps to find any kind of obstacle. We did an initial simulation implementation first then we jump to the final implementation and hardware installation.

## Features & Functionalities
* This car is controlled using mobile application.
* The car can go forward, backward, turn left and turn right.
* We can stop this car using break button form mobile app.
* Can rotate 360 degree
* Sonar sensor is used in front and IR sensor backward of the car to detect any kind of obstacle/object.
* If the sensor detects any kind of obstacle/object infront or backward of the car the call will be stopped automatically.
